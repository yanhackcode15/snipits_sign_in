https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e

Long weekend - no coding

2/20 Tuesday
* change button and input boxes to be taller for better touch usability
* changed enter keydown event to function as a tab - the default behavior is enter to submit the form, creating premature for submission
* abstract the enter key alteration into an utility service to prevent duplicating functionalities in the component
* more on-tablet testing - finding the back to home button on the idle form screens (both sign in and create new) problematic, solution is to add a idle check modal to ask for more time defaulting to back to home if useri nput isn't received 

2/21 Wednesday
* add the check-idle modal (research on angular modal lib)
* added the modal using NG bootstrap
* Got it working by using @ViewChild and TemplateRef to pass the content of the modal into the modal component methods (in the example, the content was a template variable and was passed into the function that's called by the template) -->to access a DOM at the model, use ViewChild and either elementRef of templateRef
* Solving issues with re-triggering the modal on idle

2/22 Thursday
* Add an event listener on the page to listen for the (keydown) and (touchstart) event. 
* have the cancel timer function attach to the event listener. The cancel timer will cancel the current timer by ID and restart a new timer.

* Add a auto redirect upon no response received
* fix timer issue
* push it live and test on mobile screens

2/23 Friday

2/25 Sunday

2/26 Monday
* changed undo button color to gray - check
* waitlist page must update with new checkins
* fixed the sync error on waitlist page
* add the functionality to select children to check in on new customer page
* waitlist page filter for children with checkin flag to show - angular 2 ngFor with pipe and custom filter definition - ng g pipe filter ??? weird that radio button can't send boolean to firebase
* add a new customer Y/N field on waitlist, 

* test the timer canceling to make sure it's canceled
* add a notes field to allow stylist to make notes
* allow stylist to view and edit new customer information (edit will be useful when customer made mistakes while filling out)

* write a script to download customer information and save it to firebase
* write a script to download from firebase to excel and to inject into portal


Parking Lot: 
* change the background image of the landing page 
* start design the app to be the porfolio site
* set up google hangout
* set up tablets
* add a page to show customers the current customers in waiting 


* disable prompts or cached entry values for the form
* add ability on create new page to select kids to be serviced today vs. for future
* add a button on conf page to click to landing page and make the redirct happen automatically after 3 minutes
* add ability to edit profile (a view and confirm page and/or edit after creation)

* look into pulling firebase locally
* clean up css (!important is a bad practice)

Programming Theory Parking lot: 
* Better understand click sequence, the events fired
* null, undefined, empty in js
* typescript
* ES6 class definition using 'class' keyword
* OOP: 
* DI: dependency injection in js
* what is AMD: 
* Read about Design Patterns
